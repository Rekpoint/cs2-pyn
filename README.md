# CS2 AutoExec and Settings

## Launch Options
Most launch options from CS:GO are deprecated and/or no longer useful. Historically it was a useful way to automatically execute your autoexec file, but with CS2 the game will autodetect any autoexec files if they are in the correct file path location.
Enter launch options at `Steam > Library > Counter-Strike 2 (right-click) > Properties > Set Launch Options...`

## What is an Autoexec file in CS2?

The Autoexec file, short for "automatic execution," is a configuration file that automatically executes commands every time the game is started. It's worth noting that this file is not exclusive to Counter-Strike, so you probably have seen it in other games.

Now, focusing exclusively on Valve's shooter, we know this file is a crucial component of CS2, as it allows players to adapt their gaming skills according to your preferences and, above all, style of play. From adjusting mouse sensitivity to graphics settings, the Autoexec file is a gateway to fine-tuning your CS2 experience.

Put another way, the Autoexec file is a list of console commands written in text format without a default extension. Furthermore, these commands are executed in sequence when the game starts, applying your preferred settings instantly. As a result, this eliminates the need to enter these commands each time you start the game manually.

To create an autoexec:
1. First, go to your CS2 directory, usually located in the folder: "Steam" STEAMID" "Steam".
2. Generate a new text file and rename it "autoexec.cfg" here.
3. Ensure the file extension is ".cfg" and not ".txt".
4. Open this file with a text editor.
